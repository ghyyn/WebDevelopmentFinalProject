            <h2><span class="text-primary">Three Storey House</h2>
            <p>This three storey modern house not only meets the needs of eating, sleeping, but also serve as a place of enjoyment and relaxation. On the third floor has a Karaoke room equipped with hi-tech audio system, lively lighting equipment and modern interior to become a place for everyone in the family to relieve stress, meet and entertain together after working hours.</p>
            <p>Modern beauty must be associated with strong vitality, fresh and friendly with the environment. As such, green patches are spread across floors, especially in the ground floor and terrace areas, adding elements of wood and earth for added harmony. A small corner with wooden furniture and a teapot is ideal for an informal family reunion, a catalyst for the family’s bond.</p>

        <h2><span class="text-primary">Residential House (Apartment)</h2>
            <p>An apartment is part of a collection of similar units in one building structure. An important feature is that you have to rent the place from a landlord. Oftentimes, apartments have many convenience factors like an on-site repair worker, laundry, gym facilities or a pool. Though you don’t get as much privacy and you won’t be building equity on your residence, there are many additional pros and cons to weigh when deciding whether to buy or rent.</p>
            <p>Pros: Repairs and maintenance are taken care of
                Cons: No option to purchase, less flexibility and freedom</p>

        <h2><span class="text-primary">Residential House (Condominium)</h2>
            <p>If you like the conveniences that come with an apartment but are looking to own, a condo might be a great fit for you. Instead of having a building manager or landlord oversee your unit, you’re in charge of all the repairs and the upkeep. Condos are a great option for city living and for older adults who want to own and have a mortgage but don’t want to deal with the upkeep of a single-family home.</p>
            <p>Pros: Less upkeep than a single-family home, with the benefits of homeownership
                Cons: Less privacy and free agency</p>
