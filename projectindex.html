                            <p>Residential property is any building or unit zoned and purposed as living space. It’s one of two general categories of real estate, the other being commercial property.</p>
                            <p>Residential property is usually owner-occupied, but not necessarily. By real estate industry convention, any properties with fewer than five units — none of which are for commercial use — are classified as residential. Larger properties and those with mixed residential and commercial use, then, qualify as commercial.</p>
